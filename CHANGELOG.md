## 1.0.0 (2015-12-22)

Changes:

- Bumped version to 1.0.0 as it has become quite feature full and it has a slight breakage factor. 
- Stripe Connect standalone account support. All modules were refactored to allow api key to flow thru
- Refactored all subscriptions/invoices to their own modules. Expect a few rough edges there.
- Improved the README
