  @moduledoc "Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either\ngenerated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments\nthat may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,\nStripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note\nthat finalizing the invoice,\n[when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does\nnot happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits\nuntil one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last\nwebhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have\nconnected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after\ncreation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your\n[email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),\nStripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These\nemails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the\namount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually\ncharged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge\nper currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the\ninvoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the\ncustomer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer's credit balance are\n[here](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/sending)"

    @typedoc "The `invoice` type.\n\n  * `account_country` The country of the business associated with this invoice, most often the business creating the invoice.\n  * `account_name` The public name of the business associated with this invoice, most often the business creating the invoice.\n  * `account_tax_ids` The account tax IDs associated with the invoice. Only editable when the invoice is a draft.\n  * `amount_due` Final amount due at this time for this invoice. If the invoice's total is smaller than the minimum charge amount, for example, or if there is account credit that can be applied to the invoice, the `amount_due` may be 0. If there is a positive `starting_balance` for the invoice (the customer owes money), the `amount_due` will also take that into account. The charge that gets generated for the invoice will be for the amount specified in `amount_due`.\n  * `amount_paid` The amount, in cents (or local equivalent), that was paid.\n  * `amount_remaining` The difference between amount_due and amount_paid, in cents (or local equivalent).\n  * `amount_shipping` This is the sum of all the shipping amounts.\n  * `application` ID of the Connect Application that created the invoice.\n  * `application_fee_amount` The fee in cents (or local equivalent) that will be applied to the invoice and transferred to the application owner's Stripe account when the invoice is paid.\n  * `attempt_count` Number of payment attempts made for this invoice, from the perspective of the payment retry schedule. Any payment attempt counts as the first attempt, and subsequently only automatic retries increment the attempt count. In other words, manual payment attempts after the first attempt do not affect the retry schedule. If a failure is returned with a non-retryable return code, the invoice can no longer be retried unless a new payment method is obtained. Retries will continue to be scheduled, and attempt_count will continue to increment, but retries will only be executed if a new payment method is obtained.\n  * `attempted` Whether an attempt has been made to pay the invoice. An invoice is not attempted until 1 hour after the `invoice.created` webhook, for example, so you might not want to display that invoice as unpaid to your users.\n  * `auto_advance` Controls whether Stripe performs [automatic collection](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection) of the invoice. If `false`, the invoice's state doesn't automatically advance without an explicit action.\n  * `automatic_tax` \n  * `automatically_finalizes_at` The time when this invoice is currently scheduled to be automatically finalized. The field will be `null` if the invoice is not scheduled to finalize in the future. If the invoice is not in the draft state, this field will always be `null` - see `finalized_at` for the time when an already-finalized invoice was finalized.\n  * `billing_reason` Indicates the reason why the invoice was created.\n\n* `manual`: Unrelated to a subscription, for example, created via the invoice editor.\n* `subscription`: No longer in use. Applies to subscriptions from before May 2018 where no distinction was made between updates, cycles, and thresholds.\n* `subscription_create`: A new subscription was created.\n* `subscription_cycle`: A subscription advanced into a new period.\n* `subscription_threshold`: A subscription reached a billing threshold.\n* `subscription_update`: A subscription was updated.\n* `upcoming`: Reserved for simulated invoices, per the upcoming invoice endpoint.\n  * `charge` ID of the latest charge generated for this invoice, if any.\n  * `collection_method` Either `charge_automatically`, or `send_invoice`. When charging automatically, Stripe will attempt to pay this invoice using the default source attached to the customer. When sending an invoice, Stripe will email this invoice to the customer with payment instructions.\n  * `created` Time at which the object was created. Measured in seconds since the Unix epoch.\n  * `currency` Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html), in lowercase. Must be a [supported currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies).\n  * `custom_fields` Custom fields displayed on the invoice.\n  * `customer` The ID of the customer who will be billed.\n  * `customer_address` The customer's address. Until the invoice is finalized, this field will equal `customer.address`. Once the invoice is finalized, this field will no longer be updated.\n  * `customer_email` The customer's email. Until the invoice is finalized, this field will equal `customer.email`. Once the invoice is finalized, this field will no longer be updated.\n  * `customer_name` The customer's name. Until the invoice is finalized, this field will equal `customer.name`. Once the invoice is finalized, this field will no longer be updated.\n  * `customer_phone` The customer's phone number. Until the invoice is finalized, this field will equal `customer.phone`. Once the invoice is finalized, this field will no longer be updated.\n  * `customer_shipping` The customer's shipping information. Until the invoice is finalized, this field will equal `customer.shipping`. Once the invoice is finalized, this field will no longer be updated.\n  * `customer_tax_exempt` The customer's tax exempt status. Until the invoice is finalized, this field will equal `customer.tax_exempt`. Once the invoice is finalized, this field will no longer be updated.\n  * `customer_tax_ids` The customer's tax IDs. Until the invoice is finalized, this field will contain the same tax IDs as `customer.tax_ids`. Once the invoice is finalized, this field will no longer be updated.\n  * `default_payment_method` ID of the default payment method for the invoice. It must belong to the customer associated with the invoice. If not set, defaults to the subscription's default payment method, if any, or to the default payment method in the customer's invoice settings.\n  * `default_source` ID of the default payment source for the invoice. It must belong to the customer associated with the invoice and be in a chargeable state. If not set, defaults to the subscription's default source, if any, or to the customer's default source.\n  * `default_tax_rates` The tax rates applied to this invoice, if any.\n  * `description` An arbitrary string attached to the object.

If the invoice has not been finalized yet, this will be null.\n  * `footer` Footer displayed on the invoice.\n  * `from_invoice` Details of the invoice that was cloned. See the [revision documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/invoice-revisions) for more details.\n  * `hosted_invoice_url` The URL for the hosted invoice page, which allows customers to view and pay an invoice. If the invoice has not been finalized yet, this will be null.\n  * `id` Unique identifier for the object. This property is always present unless the invoice is an upcoming invoice. See [Retrieve an upcoming invoice](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/upcoming) for more details.\n  * `invoice_pdf` The link to download the PDF for the invoice. If the invoice has not been finalized yet, this will be null.\n  * `issuer` \n  * `last_finalization_error` The error encountered during the previous attempt to finalize the invoice.

Objects of the same type share the same value.\n  * `on_behalf_of` The account (if any) for which the funds of the invoice payment are intended. If set, the invoice will be presented with the branding and support information of the specified account. See the [Invoices with Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/connect) documentation for details.\n  * `paid` Whether payment was successfully collected for this invoice. An invoice can be paid (most commonly) with a charge or with credit from the customer's account balance.\n  * `paid_out_of_band` Returns true if the invoice was manually marked paid, returns false if the invoice hasn't been paid yet or was paid on Stripe.\n  * `payment_intent` The PaymentIntent associated with this invoice. The PaymentIntent is generated when the invoice is finalized, and can then be used to pay the invoice. Note that voiding an invoice will cancel the PaymentIntent.\n  * `payment_settings` \n  * `period_end` End of the usage period during which invoice items were added to this invoice. This looks back one period for a subscription invoice. Use the [line item period](/api/invoices/line_item#invoice_line_item_object-period) to get the service period for each price.\n  * `period_start` Start of the usage period during which invoice items were added to this invoice. This looks back one period for a subscription invoice.

To ensure that the actual proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass the <code>subscription_details.proration_date</code> parameter when doing the actual subscription update. The recommended way to get only the prorations being previewed is to consider only proration line items where <code>period[start]</code> is equal to the <code>subscription_details.proration_date</code> value passed in the request. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Currency conversion calculations use the latest exchange rates.
