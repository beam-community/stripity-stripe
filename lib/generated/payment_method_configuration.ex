  @moduledoc "PaymentMethodConfigurations control which payment methods are displayed to your customers when you don't explicitly specify payment method types. You can have multiple configurations with different sets of payment methods for different scenarios.\n\nThere are two types of PaymentMethodConfigurations. Which is used depends on the [charge type](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/charges):\n\n**Direct** configurations apply to payments created on your account, including Connect destination charges, Connect separate charges and transfers, and payments not involving Connect.\n\n**Child** configurations apply to payments created on your connected accounts using direct charges, and charges with the on_behalf_of parameter.\n\nChild configurations have a `parent` that sets default values and controls which settings connected accounts may override. You can specify a parent ID at payment time, and Stripe will automatically resolve the connected accountâ€™s associated child configuration. Parent configurations are [managed in the dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods/connected_accounts) and are not available in this API.\n\nRelated guides:\n- [Payment Method Configurations API](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/payment-method-configurations)\n- [Multiple configurations on dynamic payment methods](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/multiple-payment-method-configs)\n- [Multiple configurations for your Connect accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/multiple-payment-method-configurations)"
