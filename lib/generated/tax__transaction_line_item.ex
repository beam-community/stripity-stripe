This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format.\n  * `object` String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value.\n  * `product` The ID of an existing [Product](https://stripe.com/docs/api/products/object).\n  * `quantity` The number of units of the item being purchased. For reversals, this is the quantity reversed.\n  * `reference` A custom identifier for this line item in the transaction.\n  * `reversal` If `type=reversal`, contains information about what was reversed.\n  * `tax_behavior` Specifies whether the `amount` includes taxes.
